<h1 align="center" id="title">AI Colorization Model</h1>

<p id="description">This project implements an image colorization model that converts black-and-white (grayscale) images into color images using deep learning. It leverages OpenCV's deep neural network (DNN) module and a pre-trained Caffe model for colorization. The implementation is inspired by OpenCV's sample colorization script and utilizes a model developed by researchers at UC Berkeley.</p>

<h2>üßê Features</h2>

Here're some of the project's best features:

*   Converts black-and-white images to color.
*   Uses a pre-trained deep learning model for colorization.
*   Displays both the original black-and-white and colorized images in resizable windows.
